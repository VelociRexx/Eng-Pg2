      Whether an adaptation is good or bad is irrelevant to this discussion, the
      only thing that matters is if the adaptation is faithful to the original
      material. Being faithful to the material is not always making the
      recreation a 1:1 of the original content, if that is even possible.
      Changing the material can still be successful, if you keep to the original
      themes and ideas, you can get away with changing the original, even in
      drastic ways. Starship Troopers is a good example of this, where the book
      is drastically different from the original. The book was a story that
      tackled concepts such as suffrage, corporal and capital punishment, and
      civil virtue. The movie tackles these concepts as well, but changes a
      memorable part of the original.

      the book is a novel published in 1959, in which we follow Juan "Johnny"
      Rico in his journey through his rise in the modern military’s “Mobile
      Infantry.” The book takes place roughly 700 years in the future, with the
      entire planet run by a world government. This world government came to be
      after the collapse of “western style democracies,” where anyone who holds
      full citizenship must earn it through Federal Service. Nobody is born with
      full citizenship, but basic rights, such as freedom of speech and assembly
      are given to all. Certain government positions are only available to full
      citizenship people. The book explores what a society run by veterans would
      look like, the morality of

      >
      punishment , and what a society with equal individuals would look like
      with these ideas in place. A huge part of the book was that in the Mobile
      Infantry, or MI, each soldier was controlling a highly advanced power suit
      that looked almost like a gorilla. It was something similar to a Halo
      power suit. The novel ends with Johnny on his ship over the “bug” capital
      planet, about to drop to the planet with his platoon, of which his father
      had become a sergeant in.

      the movie, which came out in 1997 is very similar to the book, with a few
      plot changes to make it better in a movie format. These changes mostly
      include changing the ending to feel like a proper conclusion to a story,
      where a “thinking” bug, a leader for the otherwise mindless swarm is
      captured, giving humanity the edge, an edge they need to catapult their
      advantage in their war against the “bugs”. This is not the widely disputed
      part of the story, however. That part belongs to the movie’s change from a
      serious drama to a comedy, and instead of having power suits for each
      individual soldier, the standard MI infantry man was some light body
      armor, and a Morita MK1 (A rifle based on the Ruger Mini-14). The director
      changed the humans from highly advanced cybernetically enhanced warriors
      into a Russian human wave tactic. As one can imagine, hardcore fans of the
      book were mortified at the apparent mockery of their beloved novel, and
      attacked the movie. All you could hear about it was that it completely
      abandoned the ideas of the book, and replaced it with some campy humour
      and some not so indirect commentary on facism, such as the

      The question is, were those critics right? Was the movie a gross insult to
      the book's concepts and ideas, or did it absorb these ideas and put them
      in another light with a new lens? Plain and simple, Starship Troopers the
      movie is a great and faithful recreation of the original book. The movie
      brings forth discussion on most of the issues that the book was known for.
      The concept of full citizenship through service is very present in the
      movie, and the history of earth is largely the same as the novel. There
      are certain areas of the book that the movie even expands upon, such as
      the way a government run entirely by cold hearted veterans might lead to
      some moral dilemmas. A famous example of this in the book and movie would
      be the attack upon
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires"
        >Buenos Aires</a
      >, and humanity, by the bugs. The novel touches on the attack, but other
      than a driving force for Johnny when he learns his mother dies in the
      attack and the driving incident for the “bug” war, it is rarely mentioned
      again. In the movie, both of Johnny’s parents die, and there is countless
      propaganda shown throughout the movie made to be a rallying cry for war
      against the bugs. The big change they made to the movie was removing the
      power armour and making the troopers numerous and expendable, and turning
      the movie’s tone into more of a comedic one.

      In short, while Starship Troopers is changed dramatically from its
      original novel, it still explores many of the same ideas that the novel
      did, and in some areas expanded what the book started. By keeping the main
      themes of the novel, Starship Troopers the movie is a faithful adaptation
      to the big screen
